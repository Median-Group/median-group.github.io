<h2 id="modeling-ai-progress-through-insights">Modeling <span class="caps">AI</span> progress through&nbsp;insights</h2>
<p>This <a href="insights">interactive model</a> calculates the time it would take to reach
the cumulation of all <span class="caps">AI</span> research, based on a guess at what percentage of <span class="caps">AI</span>
discoveries have been made. The model relies on a dataset of previous <span class="caps">AI</span>
discoveries that suggests that the rate of such discoveries has been linear
since the invention of the electronic&nbsp;computer.</p>
<h2 id="feasibility-of-training-an-agi-using-deep-reinforcement-learning-a-very-rough-estimate">Feasibility of Training an <span class="caps">AGI</span> using Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Very Rough&nbsp;Estimate</h2>
<p>Several months, we were presented with a scenario for how artificial general intelligence (<span class="caps">AGI</span>) may be achieved in the near future. We found the approach surprising, so we attempted to produce a rough model to investigate its feasibility. The document presents the model and its&nbsp;conclusions.</p>
<p>The usual cliches about the folly of trying to predict the future go without saying and this shouldn&#8217;t be treated as a rigorous estimate, but hopefully it can give a loose, rough sense of some of the relevant quantities involved. The notebook and the data used for it can be found in the Median Group <a href="https://github.com/Median-Group/numbers">numbers GitHub repo</a> if the reader is interested in using different quantities or changing the structure of the&nbsp;model. </p>

<p><a href="docs/DRAFT_PostOilTechStack_HistoricalContext.pdf">Early partial&nbsp;draft</a></p>
<p>Declining prices for solar energy capture and storage technologies herald the 
end of international petrochemical trade value within the next decade. The 
following brief period of transition, in which petrochemicals are 
commercially devalued but still strategically valuable for military purposes, 
will destabilize states whose revenues are dependent on petrochemical sales; 
and such destabilization may lead such states to pursue regional or global 
conflict to maintain their sovereignty and quality of life. This forthcoming 
paper examines the historical context, technological trends, and political 
incentives that will characterize this period, and what might be done to avert 
the most destructive&nbsp;outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="hymenoptera-simulation">Hymenoptera&nbsp;simulation</h2>
<p>This project is a synthesis of research on cognitive and behavioral abilities of 
hymenopteran insects, integrating existing empirical research in order to 
generate a template for the capabilities that an <span class="caps">AI</span> would need in order to 
effectively model insect behavior. This will also include projections of the 
time-frame within which an <span class="caps">AI</span> with such capabilities could be produced, 
if indeed current methodology is adequate for this goal. Previous work in this 
area has concentrated on replicating specific insect abilities in isolation from 
one another, and there is a need for work delineating the computational 
requirements for simulating the integrated behavioral schema of an advanced 
social insect, such as the&nbsp;honeybee. </p>
<h2 id="conditions-for-intellectual-progress">Conditions for intellectual&nbsp;progress</h2>
<p>We plan to examine the impact of organizational structures on technical 
and scientific progress, with a focus on the 20th and 21st centuries, to better 
understand what circumstances allow for the development and prudent use 
of new technologies that significantly benefit humanity. The work will focus
 in particular on methods of organizing intellectual progress that were novel 
for their time (such as the Macy cybernetics conferences) and their impacts 
on more traditional, formal&nbsp;structures.</p>

    <h2 id="normativity-antinormativity-studies">Normativity and Antinormativity Studies</h2>


<p>There&#39;s a lot of social &quot;dark matter&quot; where institutions and people perform badly at important tasks, all at once, where they&#39;ve demonstrated the ability to do better in other contexts. We have an explanation for this &quot;dark matter&quot;: vice-signaling, or antinormativity. Specifically, people expect to be taken care of if and only if they seem like they have something to hide, and would like to help others with something to hide.</p>
<p>You can think of this as a corollary to Alex Tabarrok&#39;s principle that <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/11/a-bet-is-a-tax-on-bullshit.html">a bet is a tax on bullshit</a>: the opposition to the resolution of bets is a subsidy for antinormative behavior.</p>
<p>Some work we&#39;ve published on this topic:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/the-debtors-revolt/">The Debtors&#39; Revolt</a> explains mechanistically how antinormativity emerges as an ecological niche in human societies, and coordinates within modern states to expropriate resources from normative agents.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://unstableontology.com/2021/04/12/on-commitments-to-anti-normativity/">On Commitments to Anti-Normativity</a> and <a href="http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/civil-law-and-political-drama/">Civil Law and Political Drama</a> describe the internal logic of vice-signaling.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://mediangroup.org/docs/the_professionals_dilemma.pdf">The Professional&#39;s Dilemma</a> explains how to create clear incentives for productive behavior, given the existence of antinormative behavior.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://mediangroup.org/docs/the_professionals_dilemma.pdf">Selfishness, preference falsification, and AI alignment</a> discusses preference falsification and collective strategies, including spite strategies, and the relevance to AI alignment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other related research topics include the theory and phenomenology of zero-sum games as played by humans, including both theoretical models and actual examples of tournaments, antitournaments, scapegoating games, and pecking orders; see <a href="https://unstableontology.com/2019/09/10/truth-telling-is-aggression-in-zero-sum-frames/">Truth-telling is aggression in zero-sum frames</a>.</p>

<h2 id="modeling-ai-progress-through-insights">Modeling <span class="caps">AI</span> progress through&nbsp;insights</h2>
<p>We assembled a list of major technical insights in the history of progress in
<span class="caps">AI</span> and metadata on the discoverer(s) of each&nbsp;insight.</p>
<p>Based on this dataset, we developed an <a href="insights">interactive model</a> that
calculates the time it would take to reach the cumulation of all <span class="caps">AI</span> research,
based on a guess at what percentage of <span class="caps">AI</span> discoveries have been&nbsp;made.</p>
<p>The analysis brief below provides more information on the dataset and
methodology behind&nbsp;it.</p>

<h2 id="feasibility-of-training-an-agi-using-deep-reinforcement-learning-a-very-rough-estimate">Feasibility of Training an <span class="caps">AGI</span> using Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Very Rough&nbsp;Estimate</h2>
<p>Several months ago, we were presented with a scenario for how artificial general intelligence (<span class="caps">AGI</span>) may be achieved in the near future. We found the approach surprising, so we attempted to produce a rough model to investigate its feasibility. The document presents the model and its&nbsp;conclusions.</p>
<p>The usual cliches about the folly of trying to predict the future go without saying and this shouldn&#8217;t be treated as a rigorous estimate, but hopefully it can give a loose, rough sense of some of the relevant quantities involved. The notebook and the data used for it can be found in the Median Group <a href="https://github.com/Median-Group/numbers">numbers GitHub repo</a> if the reader is interested in using different quantities or changing the structure of the&nbsp;model. </p>

<p><a href="docs/DRAFT_PostOilTechStack_HistoricalContext.pdf">Early partial&nbsp;draft</a></p>
<p>Declining prices for solar energy capture and storage technologies herald the 
end of international petrochemical trade value within the next decade. The 
following brief period of transition, in which petrochemicals are 
commercially devalued but still strategically valuable for military purposes, 
will destabilize states whose revenues are dependent on petrochemical sales; 
and such destabilization may lead such states to pursue regional or global 
conflict to maintain their sovereignty and quality of life. This forthcoming 
paper examines the historical context, technological trends, and political 
incentives that will characterize this period, and what might be done to avert 
the most destructive&nbsp;outcomes.</p>

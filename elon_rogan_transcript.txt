J
How much time before there's regular travel back and forth to Mars?
-4.049
Roughly.
-5.512
Like a real civilization on Mars.
-4.241
E
Well, I think it's going to take a while to build a real civilization that the real of the threshold that really matters is if we're getting past the great filter is do we have enough resources on Mars such that if the if the spaceships from Earth stop coming, you could survive?
-4.185
J
Yeah.
-3.396
So that can only be just missing one little thing.
-3.963
E
You'd be like you're on a long sea voyage and the only thing you're missing is vitamin C. Uh, it's only a matter of time, you know.
-2.914
Yeah.
-3.291
And those can be curtains.
-4.883
So you've got to have all the things necessary to sustain civilization on Mars.
-3.035
J
And the reason that those ships stopped coming could be.
-3.682
World War three, or it could be due to a slow decline of civilization, so civilization here on Earth could end with a bang or a whimper or natural disasters.
-3.573
E
Yeah, asteroid impacts in the bank category.
-4.643
Yeah, it could be like a whole series of things like.
-3.063
So like what killed the dinosaurs.
-4.083
Well, it wasn't just one thing, you know, it was like a whole bunch of things happened in a row and.
-2.354
You know, while they could have taken any one of those things, they had like three things happen and no dinosaurs, which is kind of amazing that crocodiles are still here.
-3.202
J
Yeah, those fuckers, well, they're resilient crocodiles that they all that live on decayed meat and they love rotting meat.
-4.197
And so in a any kind of disastrous situation, there's a lot of dead creatures and the crocodiles love it.
-3.499
So that's why they're around crocodiles and bugs and mushrooms and shrews truths, which is why we're here.
-3.570
Yeah, exactly.
-3.308
E
Our great, great, great, great, great, great grandparents were.
-2.760
What a strange thing someone like you had to come from.
-3.578
So there's hope.
-3.478
J
There's hope for all you rodents out there.
-3.066
Yeah, well, you can go to Mars.
-2.740
Just keep doing your homework.
-3.379
Absolutely.
-4.292
So so there will be you see the great filter.
-5.288
What did you mean by that?
-2.326
E
Well, so there's something called like the Fermi paradox of like, where are the aliens?
-3.677
Yeah.
-3.042
So, you know, where are the aliens?
-1.499
And I think it was Carl Sagan that said, like, if there either are a lot of aliens or none and the either they're equally terrifying.
-3.539
Hmm.
-5.180
If there are a lot of aliens.
-1.725
J
Well, I mean, the invasion ship, you know, bug infestation just, you know, like the Starship Troopers style.
-3.471
E
Well, yeah.
-1.756
I mean, it's like an alien civilization might just give us, like, a bug infestation.
-2.654
You know, it's like, hey, we left.
-2.587
That planet was fine.
-4.268
Now it's got a bunch of bugs.
-1.910
Just go fumigate it, you know, like we fumigate a house.
-3.453
And that's certainly possible.
-3.306
And then but if there are no aliens, well, could it be that all civilizations are just destroyed before they become inter stellar?
-4.058
J
You know?
-2.840
So, uh, and I want to be clear like that.
-2.981
To the best of my knowledge, there is no evidence for alien life on Earth.
-2.011
That alien there's no there's no evidence for alien life.
-3.481
There's no direct evidence.
-2.299
E
For alien life, no.
-3.654
You know, and if somebody says, oh, what about this alien four of, you know, sighting or whatever, I'm like, listen, it's got to be at least as good as a 7-Eleven or ATM cam.
-3.359
J
OK?
-4.786
E
It's like if somebody's got to at least like an iPhone one level camera like something, you know, the problem with that is it's just too easy to fake things today, too.
-3.825
J
Yeah, sure.
-2.095
At least try hard.
-4.482
And there.
-4.673
E
Are you familiar with Commander David Fraser's account of the Tic-Tac UFO that he encountered off of the coast of San Diego?
-3.702
Like, you know, Lex Lex Friedemann?
-4.567
Yeah, Lex Freedman interviewed him on his podcast and I interviewed him as well.
-3.942
And if you ever get a chance to listen to Lex's conversation with him, it's really excellent.
-2.209
But this guy is a naval fighter pilot, and he talked about this thing that they tracked on radar that went from more than 60000 feet above sea level to one foot and less than a second shaped like a Tic TAC.
-4.031
J
No visible sign of propulsion, blocked radar, actively jammed their tracking systems and then went to their predetermined point that they were supposed to that the the fighter jet was supposed to scramble to went to it 30 miles away and, you know, a couple seconds like they have no idea how it did it.
-4.722
They don't know what it is.
-1.828
And these guys that were working for the Navy off the coast said they encountered them several times.
-3.504
They didn't know what they were.
-1.536
E
They didn't know what to do, what I just did or something.
-2.845
I mean, they do they have video of it, OK?
-3.281
They have video of it.
-1.270
They have.
-3.204
There's you ever see the New York Times article that came out in twenty seventeen about the stuff?
-4.418

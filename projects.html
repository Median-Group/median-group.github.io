<h1 id="socratic-initiative">Socratic&nbsp;Initiative</h1>
<p>The Socratic Initiative is designed to generate third-party reviews of research fields that are either too new to have their own journals and review articles, or politicized enough that public disagreements may be perceived as costly. We are developing an investigative protocol to document the reasoning behind multiple perspectives in a field with sufficient clarity for people outside the field to make valid direct comparisons between differing perspectives. The protocol is currently in testing, and potential future applications include <span class="caps">AI</span> safety and climate&nbsp;science. </p>

<h1 id="mercatoria">Mercatoria</h1>
<p>Mercatoria is a planned blockchain-based distributed system that will support financial transactions and smart contracts (similar to Ethereum), and is designed to support millions of transactions per second on a large network.  With this scalability, it will be possible to implement performant decentralized alternatives to existing internet services, such as email and social networking.  The system is currently being designed and implemented; key algorithms enabling scalability have already been&nbsp;developed.</p>

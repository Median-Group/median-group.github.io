Title: About

In a world of increasingly politicized argument, the Median Research Group sponsors and executes research towards the creation of shared knowledge for common benefit. Our research includes model-based reviews of existing bodies of research to clarify disagreements, and targeted interdisciplinary research to resolve specific questions. We also work on tools that allow others to engage in similar research.

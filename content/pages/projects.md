# Socratic Initiative

The Socratic Initiative is designed to generate third-party reviews of research fields that are either too new to have their own journals and review articles, or politicized enough that public disagreements may be perceived as costly. We are developing an investigative protocol to document the reasoning behind multiple perspectives in a field with sufficient clarity for people outside the field to make valid direct comparisons between differing perspectives. The protocol is currently in testing, and potential future applications include AI safety and climate science. For more information, see our draft protocol document, or contact us at [email].
